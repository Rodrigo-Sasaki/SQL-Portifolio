Hello! Iâ€™m Rodrigo Sasaki, a professional transitioning from digital marketing to data science. After years of experience in marketing strategies and data analysis, I decided to broaden my horizons and delve into the world of data, where I believe I can make a significant impact.

I am currently pursuing a degree in Data Science, where I am learning valuable techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. In addition to my academic training, I have been applying my knowledge to fictional projects, allowing me to explore and develop my practical skills.

I am excited to collaborate on projects that involve data analysis and the development of predictive models. I believe that combining my marketing experience with the new skills I am acquiring in data science will enable me to offer a unique and innovative approach.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you are interested in collaborating or discussing ideas on how we can leverage data to drive strategic decisions.
